# Build Journal: Hunter Pipeline Ejection — Phase 1

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Duration:** ~2 hours (ongoing)
**Status:** In Progress

---

## The Goal

Eject 20 hunter pipeline skills from the `Peleke/skills` monorepo into a standalone `Peleke/hunter` repo. This matters for three reasons:

1. **Product credibility** — the pipeline is the product; it needs its own repo, README, and identity
2. **Plugin packaging** — Claude Code marketplace packaging requires a standalone repo with `.claude-plugin/` structure
3. **Eval framework** — the 7b-e eval system needs its own CI pipeline, not buried in a skills monorepo

The pipeline has been validated through dogfooding — it generated the ACE validation deck, including running on itself recursively. Now it needs to stand alone as a shippable artifact.

## The Journey

### Phase 1A: Subtree Split

**What we tried:** `git subtree split --prefix=skills/custom/ -b hunter-extract` in the skills monorepo to extract all custom skills with full commit history.

**What happened:** Clean extraction of 68 commits into a `hunter-extract` branch. Every commit that touched `skills/custom/` was preserved with original authorship and timestamps.

**Why this matters:** The subtree split technique preserves git blame and authorship across repo boundaries. For a portfolio project where demonstrating sustained engineering work matters, this is critical. A flat `cp -r` would show one commit with everything appearing on the same day. The subtree split shows the real development history — 68 commits of iterative refinement.

**Technique:**
```bash
# In the source monorepo (Peleke/skills):
git subtree split --prefix=skills/custom/ -b hunter-extract

# In the target repo (Peleke/hunter):
git remote add skills-extract /path/to/skills
git fetch skills-extract hunter-extract
git merge skills-extract/hunter-extract --allow-unrelated-histories
```

**Lesson:** `git subtree split` is the cleanest way to extract a subdirectory into its own repo when you care about history. It rewrites commit SHAs but preserves authorship, timestamps, and diffs. Works better than `git filter-branch` for modern use cases.

### Phase 1B: Directory Restructure

**What we tried:** Reorganize the flat skill directory (29 items at one level) into 5 categorized directories matching the product's information architecture.

**What happened:** Clean restructure. The user correctly caught that non-hunter skills should be preserved, not deleted — moved to `upstream/` instead. This maintains the complete monorepo snapshot for reference while clearly separating product skills from personal tooling.

**Lesson:** When ejecting a subset from a monorepo, don't delete what you're not taking. Move it to a clearly-labeled holding area. The original monorepo still has the canonical copy; the holding area is for reference and prevents "wait, where did X go?" confusion.

### Phase 1C: Configuration + Documentation

**What we tried:** Create `.hunter-config.yaml` for pipeline configuration and a product-grade README.md.

**What happened:** Config file provides vault paths, pipeline defaults, and launchpad integration. README includes the full ASCII pipeline diagram, skills catalog with correct paths, eval framework overview, and repo layout map.

**Lesson:** The README is the product's front door. For a Claude Code plugin that will be discovered through marketplace search, the README has to immediately communicate: what it does, how it works, and how to run it.

## What's Left

- [ ] Create `.gitignore` for hunter repo
- [ ] Initial commit + push to origin
- [ ] Phase 2: Config extraction — update _conventions.md with config variable resolution
- [ ] Phase 3: Plugin packaging — `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with 5 modular plugins
- [ ] Phase 4: Eval framework — 7b-e implementation with fixtures and CI
- [ ] Phase 5: Documentation — architecture.md, configuration.md, quickstart.md
- [ ] Phase 6: Launch — v1.0.0 tag, skills monorepo cleanup, announcement

---

## Improvements

### Architectural

- Subtree split preserves authorship across repo boundaries — use this pattern for any monorepo ejection
- Category-based directory structure (core/support/research/content/community) maps cleanly to plugin sub-packages
- `upstream/` directory pattern for preserving non-extracted content without deletion

### Workflow

- Started buildlog entry at session start this time (learned from the ACE deck session where we were 4 hours in before logging)
- Epic issue created on GitHub before starting work — tracks all 6 phases with checkboxes
- Buildlog experiment session tracking active for the full ejection batch

### Tool Usage

- `git subtree split --prefix=X -b branch` — extract subdirectory with full history
- `git remote add + fetch + merge --allow-unrelated-histories` — import extracted history into new repo
- `mkdir -p` with full path creates nested category structure in one command

### Domain Knowledge

- Git subtree split rewrites SHAs but preserves authorship/timestamps/diffs
- `--allow-unrelated-histories` is required when merging a subtree-split branch into a fresh repo
- Claude Code plugin packaging expects `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at repo root

---

## Agent-Facing Notes

### For Future Pipeline Runs

When the hunter pipeline runs in this repo (dogfooding), resolve skill paths from `.hunter-config.yaml` → `skills_dir` field. If null, auto-detect from the repo root: `${REPO_ROOT}/skills/`.

### For Eval Authors

The 7b-e eval framework lives in `evals/`. Each level has its own directory:
- `evals/7b-input/` — invalid envelope fixtures (expect rejection)
- `evals/7c-output/` — valid input fixtures + JSON Schema validators
- `evals/7d-pipeline/` — full-chain integration test harnesses
- `evals/7e-quality/` — LLM-as-judge rubrics + calibration data

Run order matters: 7b and 7c gate PRs (cheap, fast). 7d and 7e run on release (expensive, comprehensive).

### For Content Generation

This buildlog entry is source material for:
- **Article 3** (Recursive Proof) — the subtree split technique and dogfooding narrative
- **LinkedIn post** — "Your AI agent skills are stuck in a monorepo. Here's how to eject them into a product."
- **buildlog-to-content pipeline** — this entry feeds the LinWheel content engine via `content-planner`

### Key Decisions Log

| Decision | Why | Alternative Considered |
|----------|-----|----------------------|
| Subtree split (not flat copy) | Preserves git history for portfolio credibility | `cp -r` — faster but loses all history |
| upstream/ (not delete) | User preference: don't destroy, relocate | `rm -rf` — cleaner but irreversible |
| Category dirs (not flat) | Maps to plugin sub-packages, improves discoverability | Flat list — simpler but 20 skills in one dir is chaos |
| .hunter-config.yaml (not env vars) | Checked into repo, self-documenting, YAML for complex structure | `.env` — simpler but not structured, not version-controlled |

## AI Experience Reflection — buildlog Tools

### What Worked Well

- **`buildlog_experiment_start` + `buildlog_commit` loop**: Once the experiment session was active, `buildlog_commit` wrapped git commits cleanly and auto-appended the commit block to the entry. The auto-logging of file lists is genuinely useful — I don't have to manually track what changed.
- **Hook enforcement**: The pre-commit hook that blocks `git commit` and forces you through `buildlog_commit` is effective. It caught me twice in this session (once in the portfolio repo, once here). Without it, I would have used bare `git commit` every time and the buildlog would be empty.
- **Entry template**: The `_TEMPLATE.md` provided good structure. Having the sections pre-defined (Goal, Architecture, Journey, Improvements) made it easy to fill in as work progressed rather than trying to reconstruct at the end.

### What Was Frustrating

- **"No active experiment session" error**: Every fresh repo requires `buildlog_experiment_start` before `buildlog_commit` works, but the error message doesn't appear until you try to commit. This means the first commit attempt always fails in a new repo. Suggestion: either auto-start a session on first commit, or have `buildlog init` create a default session.
- **Session ID opacity**: The session ID (`session-20260307-010145-825714`) is auto-generated and never referenced again. I don't know how to resume it, query it, or correlate it with the buildlog entry. The connection between sessions and entries should be more explicit.
- **`buildlog_dir` path resolution**: Had to pass the full absolute path (`/Users/peleke/Documents/Projects/hunter/buildlog`) because the tool doesn't auto-detect the buildlog directory from the current git root. When working across multiple repos in one session, this means remembering to switch the `buildlog_dir` param each time.
- **Commit file list verbosity**: The auto-appended commit block lists every file, which for a 200+ file initial commit produces a wall of text truncated with "...and 206 more". A summary (e.g., "226 files across skills/, upstream/, docs/, buildlog/") would be more useful for large commits.

### Communication Notes

- The buildlog MCP tools feel like infrastructure plumbing — reliable but invisible. The value is in the *output* (entries, reward signals, skills extraction), not the tool UX itself. That's fine for a data capture layer.
- The biggest risk is forgetting to start the experiment session. This happened in the previous session too (ACE deck). Consider making this the default state rather than an opt-in.

### Suggestions for buildlog Tool Improvements

1. **Auto-session on first commit**: If no session is active, start one automatically with the branch name as context
2. **Smart file list summarization**: For commits with >20 files, group by directory and show counts instead of listing every file
3. **`buildlog_dir` auto-detection**: Walk up from `cwd` to find the nearest `buildlog/` directory, like git does for `.git/`
4. **Session-entry linking**: Auto-add the session ID to the entry frontmatter so sessions and entries are correlated
5. **Entry slug from branch**: When `slug` isn't provided, derive it from the current branch name (we already do this but it could be more reliable across repos)
